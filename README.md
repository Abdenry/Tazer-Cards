# [Tazer Cards](https://youtu.be/0fpzKOLWwhQ?si=C4kyu5y1s3HWvBQp)
A small device I made to convert the theoretical damage taken in popular card games into tangible outcomes. It uses an Arduino Nano, a modified TENS machine, a custom health tracker written in python, and cheap spark gap generators off ebay.
This was not built with scalability in mind as it was just a whim of the moment build to play with friends, as a result it is currnetly limited to two players only.

Improvements could be made by enabling more than two players but that would also require more hardware as the TENS machine can only accomodate two players. An automatic connection detector as the Arduino Nano changes COMM port everyone once and a while which requires updating the python health tracker.
